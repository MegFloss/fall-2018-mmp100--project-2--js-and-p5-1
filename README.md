# Project 2 — JavaScript and P5
For this project, you’ll create a drawing of an animal using the `p5` JavaScript library. You’ll work on your own — **No collaborations!** Like the first project, you also must work in your own GitHub branch with the included files.

## Directions
* Include the `p5.js` library from [`cdnjs.com`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/p5.js/) via the `script` tag in the file `index.html`.
* Visit [https://a-z-animals.com/animals/](https://a-z-animals.com/animals/) and pick an animal whose name begins with the same letter as the first letter in your last name. For example, my last name is Vanegas, so I’d look under “V” and perhaps use an image of a vampire bat or vulture for my project.
* Sketch the animal much like how you’d sketch on a transparent piece of paper placed over a picture. **No stick figures.** Use Photoshop to get the coordinates of shapes and lines.
* Use any shade of grey as the background color of your sketch.
* Use at least two colors for the animal, **not** including black, white, or any neutrals. These colors can be native to the animal, or you can use two colors of your own.
* Put the animal’s name in an `h1` element and append the `h1` element to the `body` element.
* Put *your* name in an `h2` element underneath the `h1` element and append it to the `body` element.

## Rules
* Do not add or remove any files.
* The only edit to `index.html` should be the inclusion of the `p5` library and the inclusion of `sketch.js` in the `head` element.
* All your `p5`-related code must go in the file `sketch.js`.
